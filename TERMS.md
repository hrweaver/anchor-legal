# Anchor Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** January 20, 2025 (Version 1.1)

Welcome to Anchor. Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the app.

---

## Agreement to Terms

By downloading, installing, or using Anchor, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don't agree, please don't use Anchor.

---

## What Anchor Is

Anchor is a free digital wellness app designed to help you reduce phone addiction by:
- Blocking distracting apps
- Providing accountability through optional partner connections
- Tracking your app usage
- Supporting your goals with self-imposed time limits

Anchor is a tool to support your digital wellness journey. It is not a medical device, therapy, or treatment for addiction.

---

## Intended Use & Abuse Prevention

### Anchor Is For Voluntary Accountability

Anchor is designed for **voluntary, consensual accountability partnerships** between adults who mutually choose to support each other's digital wellness.

### Prohibited Uses

**This app must NOT be used to:**
- Monitor or control someone without their genuine, freely-given consent
- Coerce, pressure, or force someone into limiting their phone use
- Facilitate domestic abuse, stalking, or controlling behavior
- Monitor anyone who has not freely chosen to participate
- Track a partner's location or communications
- Monitor minor children (use dedicated parental control apps instead)

### Your Right to Leave

**Either partner may disconnect at any time**, for any reason, without the other partner's permission or knowledge. This is by design. We cannot and will not prevent disconnection.

### If You Are Being Coerced

If you are being forced to use this app against your will, or if someone is using it to control you:

- **You can uninstall the app at any time** - no one can prevent this
- **National Domestic Violence Hotline**: 1-800-799-7233
- **Text "START" to 88788** for help via text message
- **TheHotline.org** for online chat support

We take abuse seriously. If we become aware that Anchor is being used for coercive control, we reserve the right to terminate the abuser's account.

---

## Eligibility

You must be **at least 18 years old** to use Anchor.

By using Anchor, you represent that:
- You are at least 18 years old
- You have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms
- You are not prohibited from using the app under any applicable laws

---

## Your Account

### Account Creation
You create an account by setting up Anchor and choosing a display name. You don't need an email or password - your account is tied to your device.

### Your Responsibilities
You agree to:
- Provide accurate information (like your display name)
- Use Anchor only for its intended digital wellness purpose
- Respect your accountability partner's privacy and boundaries
- Not attempt to circumvent Anchor's blocking features through malicious means
- Not reverse engineer, decompile, or tamper with the app

---

## Accountability Partnerships

### How It Works
You can optionally connect with one accountability partner. When connected:
- You share app usage data with each other
- Either person can request temporary access to blocked apps
- Either person can suggest the other remove an app
- Both people receive notifications about important events

### Mutual Consent
By entering a partner's code and completing the connection, you confirm that:
- You are freely choosing to participate
- You understand what data you will share (see Privacy Policy)
- You understand what data you will receive about your partner
- No one is forcing or coercing you into this partnership

### Disconnecting
Either partner may disconnect at any time by going to Settings and removing the partnership. Disconnecting:
- Takes effect immediately
- Stops all data sharing
- Does not require the other partner's approval
- Allows both users to continue using Anchor independently

We do not notify the other partner of the reason for disconnection.

---

## Safety Features

Certain features cannot be disabled to ensure your safety:

### Always Accessible
The following are always accessible, even when blocking is enabled:
- **Emergency services** (911, emergency dialer)
- **Phone and calling apps**
- **System settings**
- **Play Store** (for updates)
- **Anchor itself**
- **Your keyboard apps**

### Boot Grace Period
If enabled, blocking is paused for 60 seconds after your phone restarts. This ensures you can always access Settings if something goes wrong.

---

## Solo Mode

If you don't have an accountability partner, you can use Anchor in "Solo Mode":
- A random 6-digit PIN is generated
- You store this PIN somewhere inconvenient (not on your phone)
- The PIN is required to modify settings
- You can reset Solo Mode by clearing app data, but this resets all your settings

---
